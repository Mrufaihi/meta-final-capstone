# Little Lemon Restaurant - Capstone Project

A modern, responsive web application for Little Lemon Restaurant featuring online table reservations and ordering capabilities. This is the capstone project for Meta's Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera.

## About Little Lemon

**Little Lemon** is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant located in Chicago, Illinois, blending traditional recipes with a modern twist.

### The Business

- **Owners:** Two Italian brothers
  - **Mario:** Head chef who relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy
  - **Adrian:** Handles marketing and led the expansion to incorporate broader Mediterranean cuisines
- **Cuisine:** Mediterranean (Italian, Greek, Turkish influences)
- **Menu:** 12-15 seasonal items featuring traditional recipes with a modern twist
- **Atmosphere:** Rustic and relaxed with moderate prices
- **Operating Hours:**
  - Monday - Friday: 2pm - 10pm
  - Saturday: 2pm - 11pm
  - Sunday: 2pm - 9pm

### The Challenge

Little Lemon currently has a basic website but lacks:

- Modern, user-friendly UI/UX design
- Online table reservation system
- Online ordering functionality
- Professional, responsive design that works across all devices

**Business Impact:** Without these features, Little Lemon is losing potential customers who expect modern online booking and ordering capabilities, and their staff spends too much time handling phone reservations.
